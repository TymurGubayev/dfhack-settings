# Why?

This repository is a collection of custom configuration files
for various [dfhack](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/releases)-plugins
for
[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
(btw., please [support them](https://www.patreon.com/bay12games)).

# How?

This repository is meant for the root DF directory
(this is the reason why `.gitignore` is so strange).
I.e. `.git`-directory is in the very same directory `Dwarf Fortress.exe` resides.
It was setup from
[PeridexisErrant's DF Starter Pack](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076.0)
but should *probably* work for every other version.
